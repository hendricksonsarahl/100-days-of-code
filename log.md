# 100 Days Of Code - Log - VARIATION from the rules: I'm working through a highly time-intensive code school, LaunchCode, and much of my hours of code work per day will include a mix of reading/watching videos, coding along with tutorials, and coding on my own. I will include this work in my daily count only while I am in school. 

#Day 0: June 23. Friday

Today's Progress: Caught up on Flask app refactoring using html templating

#Day 4: June 27. Tuesday

Today's Progress: Played around with SQL database on MAMP, learned more about databases via w3schools

Thoughts: Realizing making a habit of these logs is harder than I thought! Adding a google calendar event for 5:30pm every day to remind me to enter a log.
