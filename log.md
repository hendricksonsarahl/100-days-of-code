# 100 Days Of Code - Log - VARIATION from the rules: I'm working through a highly time-intensive code school, LaunchCode, and much of my hours of code work per day will include a mix of reading/watching videos, coding along with tutorials, and coding on my own. I will include this work in my daily count only while I am in school. 

Day 0: June 23. Friday

Today's Progress: Caught up on Flask app refactoring using html templating

Today's Progress: Reviewed some more SQL on w3schools and 3 hours of class!
