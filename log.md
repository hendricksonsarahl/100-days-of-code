# 100 Days Of Code - Log - VARIATION from the rules: I'm working through a highly time-intensive code school, LaunchCode, and much of my hours of code work per day will include a mix of reading/watching videos, coding along with tutorials, and coding on my own. I will include this work in my daily count only while I am in school.
